    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Daniel Longeuay, a software engineer with a passion for DevOps, programming, and web development.
    </p>
    <p>
      I created this blog to share my experiences, tutorials, and thoughts on the tools and technologies I work with daily. Whether it's containerization, CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, or building web applications, I enjoy diving deep into technical topics and making them approachable.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not writing code, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open source, or tinkering with my home lab setup.
    </p>
