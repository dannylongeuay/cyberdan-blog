Welcome to my blog! This is a quick tour of the stack powering this site and a chance to show off the syntax highlighting.

## The Stack

This blog is built with [Astro](https://astro.build) — a fast, content-focused static site generator. Styling is handled by Tailwind CSS v4, and posts are written in MDX so I can embed components directly in my articles.

## Code Examples

Here's a TypeScript utility for formatting dates:

```typescript
function formatDate(date: Date): string {
  return date.toLocaleDateString("en-US", {
    year: "numeric",
    month: "long",
    day: "numeric",
  });
}

const today = formatDate(new Date());
console.log(`Today is ${today}`);
```

A simple Express server in JavaScript:

```javascript
import express from "express";

const app = express();

app.get("/api/health", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ status: "ok", timestamp: Date.now() });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on port 3000");
});
```

And a multi-stage Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM node:22-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json bun.lock ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

## What's Next

I'll be writing about DevOps workflows, programming patterns, and whatever else catches my attention. Stay tuned!
